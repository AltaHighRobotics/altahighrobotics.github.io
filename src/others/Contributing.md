## How to add content to these notes:
The format for these notes are not very normal as they do not follow the same format as a normal html website would, if you've done soe inspecting you've seen that instead this website uses elements such as [.scss](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-is-the-difference-between-css-and-scss/) files, [liquid](https://shopify.github.io/liquid/), and github's [jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/github-pages/) website format that allows for markdown files to be displayed as if they were normal html files.

These may seem overly-complicated (they are) but they allow for a pretty simple way for you to format your website once you get into it and understand the niche syntax of some of these elements. <b>BUT</b> fear not, if you feel as if this is too much for you, it is perfectly fine to write your notes in normal html format without having to worry that it will break the webpage. But it is recommended to follow normal markdown formatting

(If you want to get more practice with the markdown language, a highly recommended tool to use is [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) which lets you take notes very neatly in a nice file/folder system that fits very well with programming. Ask Edwards about it)

## Getting started:
It is recommended that you edit the repository through VSCode rather than through github's gui, so make sure you have the [Github repository](https://github.com/AltaHighRobotics/altahighrobotics.github.io.git) downloaded for easier editing

### It is highly recommended to use the [just-the-docs](https://just-the-docs.com) guide
It has all the examples and trinkets that you might need to add stuff to this website


I might work on this more a bit later, for now this is good enough, if you have any questions shoot me a DM on [Discord](https://discordapp.com/users/714918826831118436)
